## Mozilla Express Tutorial - Follow along
By: Luuk Leeuwenstein

This was a follow along of the tutorial at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs. Most code is copied, though all principles also require a single manual implementation. The goal was to understand `Node.js`, `NPM`, and the MVC architecture.

### Run instructions
To run, use:
'SET DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:* & npm run devstart'

or

'SET DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:* & npm start'
