## Mozilla Express Tutorial - Follow along
By: Luuk Leeuwenstein

This is a follow along of the tutorial at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs. Most code is copied, though all principles also require a single manual implementation. The goal is to understand `Node.js`, `NPM`, and the MVC architecture.

I am currently at the following step:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/forms;
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/forms/Create_book_form
